 There are 3 ports open: 22 (ssh), 80 (http), 6667 (irc)
 
## HTTP - Port 80

The index.php page tells us the new webpage, /jabc, so I'll just run my scans on that.

### Gobuster

`gobuster dir -u http://x.x.x.204/jabc -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -o gobuster.txt -x php,html,txt,xml`

A lot to go through, inclduing a heap of results in /robots.txt

But, if we just check source codes first, the documentation page contains hidden (through turning the text colour to black) information

### /jabcd0cs

The hidden information contains the directory `/jabcd0cs/` and login credentials of `guest : guest`

#### Add Document

This tab gives us the ability to upload a file to the website which immediately strikes interest in the possility of uploading a reverse web shell

I try using the `php-reverse-shell` stored on kali in `/usr/share/webshells/php` but we are rejected due to an invalid MIMETYPE. However, we are also given a list on accepted types to choose from

Appending `.png` to `shell.php` also isn't enough to bypass the filter
